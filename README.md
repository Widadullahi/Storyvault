## Project Overview

Historical and cultural information about Africa is often distributed across different websites, archives, articles, educational platforms, digital libraries, and institutional resources.

Researchers may need to spend significant amounts of time searching through multiple sources, comparing information, identifying relevant facts, organizing timelines, and keeping track of the origin of each claim.

StoryVault Africa addresses this challenge through an Apify-powered research Actor that helps users collect and organize publicly available information around a specific research topic.

A user can provide a topic such as:

- The Benin Kingdom
- Queen Amina of Zazzau
- The Nigerian Civil War
- Yoruba cultural heritage
- The Nok Civilization
- The history of Lagos
- African traditional institutions
- Nigerian independence
- Indigenous African knowledge systems

StoryVault then processes the configured research sources and generates a structured research output for further exploration and human verification.

## The Problem

Researching African history and culture can be difficult for several reasons.

### 1. Information is scattered

Relevant information is often distributed across different websites, publications, educational resources, digital archives, and institutional pages.

Researchers have to search multiple sources manually before obtaining a complete understanding of a topic.

### 2. Research is time-consuming

Students, educators, journalists, and content creators spend considerable time gathering information, opening different pages, extracting important details, and organizing their findings.

### 3. Sources are difficult to track

When information is copied into notes or documents, the original source may be forgotten or difficult to locate later.

This makes it harder to verify claims and conduct further research.

### 4. Historical information may conflict

Different sources can provide different dates, names, interpretations, or descriptions of historical events.

A research tool should not automatically treat every extracted claim as confirmed fact.

### 5. African history and cultural knowledge need greater accessibility

African historical and cultural information should be easier for learners, researchers, educators, and digital creators to discover and explore.

There is an opportunity to build tools that improve access to this information while preserving source traceability and encouraging responsible research.

---

## Our Solution

StoryVault Africa is an AI-assisted research Actor that collects publicly available information about a selected historical or cultural topic and organizes the results into a structured research pack.

Instead of requiring users to manually gather information from multiple sources, StoryVault helps automate the initial research and organization process.

The Actor is designed to:

1. Accept a research topic from the user.
2. Identify or process configured research sources.
3. Extract relevant publicly available information.
4. Organize information into structured sections.
5. Preserve source URLs for traceability.
6. Identify historical entities and relevant context.
7. Organize important events into a timeline where possible.
8. Highlight information that may require additional human verification.
9. Store the results in an Apify Dataset or the configured output destination.

StoryVault is not designed to replace historians, researchers, archivists, or subject-matter experts.

It is designed to reduce repetitive research work and support better-informed human investigation.

---

## Why StoryVault Matters

StoryVault combines research automation with African historical and cultural discovery.

The project is focused on building an accessible research infrastructure that can support:

- African history education
- Cultural knowledge discovery
- Academic research
- Digital storytelling
- Documentary research
- Educational content development
- Historical preservation initiatives
- Cultural institutions and archives

By organizing information and preserving source links, StoryVault can help users move from scattered online information to a more structured research workflow.

The long-term vision is to support a research ecosystem where African historical and cultural topics can be explored more efficiently and responsibly.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Topic-Based Research

Users can submit a research topic such as a historical figure, kingdom, cultural practice, event, or institution.

Example:

```json
{
  "topic": "The Benin Kingdom"
}
```

The Actor uses the provided configuration to process relevant research information.

---

### 2. Historical and Cultural Research

StoryVault is designed for research topics related to:

- Historical kingdoms
- Historical figures
- Political and social events
- Cultural practices
- Indigenous knowledge
- Traditional institutions
- Historical locations
- African civilizations
- Colonial and postcolonial history
- Cultural heritage

---

### 3. Structured Research Output

Instead of returning only unorganized scraped text, StoryVault aims to arrange collected information into meaningful sections.

Possible sections include:

- Topic overview
- Key facts
- Historical context
- Timeline
- Important entities
- Source list
- Verification notes
- Research limitations

The exact output depends on the Actor's implemented schema.

---

### 4. Source Traceability

StoryVault preserves source URLs where available.

This allows users to:

- Return to the original source
- Review the context of a claim
- Conduct additional research
- Compare information across sources
- Validate extracted information

Source links should be treated as references for further investigation rather than automatic proof that every extracted claim is accurate.

---

### 5. Timeline Organization

Where dates and events can be extracted reliably, StoryVault can organize historical events chronologically.

A timeline may include:

- Event date
- Event title
- Event description
- Related entities
- Source URL
- Verification notes

Dates that are unclear, approximate, or conflicting should be identified for further review.

---

### 6. Entity Identification

The research output may identify important entities associated with a topic.

These can include:

- Historical figures
- Kingdoms
- Communities
- Organizations
- Locations
- Events
- Cultural institutions

Entity extraction should be reviewed where names, spellings, historical identities, or relationships are uncertain.

---

### 7. Verification Awareness

StoryVault is designed to support responsible research.

Where possible, the system can identify:

- Missing information
- Conflicting claims
- Unclear dates
- Incomplete source details
- Claims requiring human review

The Actor should not present uncertain information as definitively verified.

---

### 8. Apify Dataset Integration

The Actor uses the Apify platform's storage and execution infrastructure.

Research results can be stored in an Apify Dataset when configured in the implementation.

This supports:

- Structured data storage
- Research result retrieval
- Repeated Actor runs
- Integration with other applications
- Potential API-based access

---

### 9. Automation-Friendly Research

By running as an Apify Actor, StoryVault can potentially be integrated into larger workflows.

Possible integrations include:

- Educational platforms
- Research dashboards
- AI assistants
- Content creation tools
- Digital archive projects
- Academic research applications

---

---

## 🔌 Apify Integration

StoryVault is built around the Apify platform.

Apify provides infrastructure for running Actors, collecting data, storing structured results, and integrating automated workflows.

### Apify Features Used or Intended

- Actor execution
- Actor input configuration
- Dataset storage
- API-based Actor execution
- Structured output
- Run monitoring

### Why Apify?
Apify allows StoryVault to focus on its research use case while leveraging existing infrastructure for web automation and data processing.

This can reduce the need to build an entire crawling and execution infrastructure from scratch.

Apify also provides opportunities for future integration with other Actors, APIs, and automated research workflows.

---

## Input Configuration
The input schema must match the actual input schema configured in the Apify Actor.

The following is an illustrative example:

```json
{
  "topic": "The Benin Kingdom",
  "researchType": "historical",
  "scope": "Nigeria",
  "maxSources": 10,
  "startUrls": []
}
```

### Input Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `topic` | String | The historical or cultural topic to research |
| `researchType` | String | The type of research being requested |
| `scope` | String | The geographical or thematic scope |
| `maxSources` | Number | The maximum number of sources to process, if supported |
| `startUrls` | Array | URLs supplied for research, if supported |

### Example Research Topics

```text
The Benin Kingdom
```

```text
Queen Amina of Zazzau
```

```text
The history of Lagos
```

```text
Yoruba cultural heritage
```

```text
The Nok Civilization
```

The actual input fields, default values, and validation rules should be confirmed in the deployed Actor's input schema.

---

## Output Structure

The Actor's output schema must reflect the actual data returned by the deployed implementation.

The following example illustrates a possible research output format:

```json
{
  "topic": "The Benin Kingdom",
  "overview": "A structured overview of the research topic.",
  "timeline": [
    {
      "date": "Example date",
      "event": "Example historical event",
      "description": "Description of the event",
      "sourceUrl": "https://example.com"
    }
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Example entity",
      "type": "Historical figure",
      "description": "Relevant information",
      "sourceUrl": "https://example.com"
    }
  ],
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Example source",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    }
  ],
  "verificationNotes": [
    "Claims should be reviewed against the original sources."
  ]
}
```

This is an illustrative structure and should not be presented as the exact output schema unless it matches the deployed Actor.

### Output Principles

The output should aim to be:

- Structured
- Readable
- Source-linked
- Reusable
- Easy to process programmatically
- Suitable for human review

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Actor

### Option 1: Run Through Apify Console

1. Open the Apify Console:

   https://console.apify.com/

2. Navigate to the Actor section.

3. Open the StoryVault Actor.

4. Select the input configuration.

5. Enter the research topic.

6. Review the input values.

7. Click the run button.

8. Wait for the Actor execution to complete.

9. Open the Dataset or output section.

10. Review the generated research results.

---

### Option 2: Run Through the Apify API

The Actor can be executed through the Apify API if API access is configured.

The API request must use:

- The correct Actor ID
- A valid Apify API token
- The appropriate input schema
- The correct API endpoint

API tokens must not be exposed in frontend code, public repositories, screenshots, or client-side applications.

Use environment variables or a secure backend to manage API credentials.

---

## 💻 API Usage

An example API request structure is shown below.

The Actor ID, input fields, and endpoint must be updated to match the deployed Actor.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/ACTOR_ID/runs?token=APIFY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topic": "The Benin Kingdom"
  }'
```

### Security Notes

- Do not hardcode API tokens in frontend code.
- Do not commit API tokens to GitHub.
- Store secrets in environment variables.
- Use backend requests when the token must remain private.
- Revoke and replace any token that has been publicly exposed.
- Apply appropriate access controls to private research data.

The API example should only be used after replacing the placeholder values with the correct Actor configuration.

---

## 🔍 Research Integrity and Verification

StoryVault is intended to assist research, not to establish historical truth automatically.

Historical and cultural information can be complex, incomplete, contested, or interpreted differently by different sources.

### Research Integrity Principles

#### Source Awareness

The system should preserve source URLs whenever possible.

#### Human Verification

Users should review original sources before relying on information for academic, journalistic, educational, or public-facing purposes.

#### Uncertainty

Information that is incomplete, conflicting, or unclear should be identified where possible.

#### No Automatic Authority

The presence of a claim in a retrieved source does not automatically mean that the claim has been independently verified.

#### Responsible Cultural Representation

Historical and cultural information should be presented respectfully and with awareness of local context.

StoryVault should avoid presenting a single source or interpretation as the complete representation of a complex cultural or historical subject.

---

## 🔖 Final Note

StoryVault Africa is designed to make historical and cultural research more organized and accessible.

The Actor supports the initial discovery and structuring of publicly available information, but users should always review original sources and apply appropriate judgment before using research results for academic, professional, educational, or public-facing purposes.

**StoryVault Africa: Discovering history. Organizing knowledge. Supporting responsible research.**
